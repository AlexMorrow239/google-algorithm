## Introduction

This project is a simplified recreation of Google's algorithm that manages all the websites it serves. This project is merely a proof of concept, so many shortcuts were taken to save money and resources. No hardware such as physical hardisks and servers were used, so a digital recreation of Hard discs were used instead stored as a HardDisk class. Additionally, only necessary features of a browser and searchEngine were implemented utilizing the respective interfaces.

## Project Structure

To understand this algorithm, I must explain the vital classes variables in its implementation

### InfoFile

This class is used to store all the data associated with each page and each word referenced on all the pages. This class can be broken down into its its attributes:

data - Contains a string which is equal to either the url or the word that this InfoFile corresponds to.

influence - A Long equal to the final influence after the page-rank algorithm is done running

influenceTemp - A long equal to the temporary influence of the file during one iteration of the page-rank algorithm

indices - an array of index positions of where

Final influence
